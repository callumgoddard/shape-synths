shape-synths
============

Interactive visually represented sound synthesis.

This has been developed using Processing and SuperCollider. Both are needed to run this code.

SuperCollider client for processing is required and can be obtained from here: http://www.erase.net/projects/processing-sc/

To run:

Run sound-shape.scd in supercollider
Run shapeSynth.pde

Note: a SuperCollider server is required to be running and sound-shape.scd is only needed to be run the first time that shapeSynth is run
